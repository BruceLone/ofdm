# OFDM

This repository contains some blocks useful for making OFDM transceivers.
This includes:

* Autocorrelator
* CORDIC (pipelined and iterative)
* Divider
* Filters
* NCO

as well as some higher level blocks that combine these to do useful OFDM things.

`src/main/resources` contains some traces from the ADI board that are useful for testing.
